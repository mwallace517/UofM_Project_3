Building a Secure Monitoring Environment
In this project, my team was tasked with creating a secure monitoring environment for a fictional organization using Splunk. During the process of creating the secure environment we tested it against simulated cyberattacks.
We then summarized our findings and monitoring effectiveness of this secure monitoring environment into a presentation for the senior management of our fictional organization.
The setup for our monitoring environment was an Apache web server (public-facing website) and a Windows operating system (backend operations).
The purpose of Splunk in this project was for log file analysis, report generation, alert creation, and creating dashboards to make monitoring more efficient.
The defensive measures used in this project were establishing baselines to identify anomalies, generate reports and alerts to detect real-time suspicious activity, and creating visual dashboards for ongoing monitoring and quick incident response.
Additionaly, we implemented an Add-On Application to Splunk called Axis Security, which gave us the ability to collect granular real-time information about users, applications, and our access policies.
Data collected from Axis Security can be revealed by the App Axis Cloud, which can be integrated into real-time dashboards and reports.
Ultimately, the goal of this project was to ensure the security and integrity of our fictional organization's critical systems by proactively identifying and responding to cyber threats.
